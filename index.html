    <h1>Moving to Denver</h1>

    <p>Hello Internet! My name is Dan and I’m currently a 2nd year MBA student at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. After graduation, I will be working for Google in their Boulder, CO office and am moving to the Denver area with my fiancé Elise sometime this summer! </p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="images/citypark.jpg" alt="Picture of Elise and I in City Park, Denver"width=40%>
    <p>I have always loved and wanted to live in Colorado, so I have been casually looking at jobs and housing in the Denver area for several years and have also visited on multiple occasions, which gave me a pretty good head start once I knew for sure I would be moving there. Over the past several months, I have done a great deal of research to prepare for the big move, and I decided to create this website in order to share the knowledge I have gained and the resources I’ve been using, so that others who are moving to the area can benefit from what I have found.</p> 
    <p>I hope that my site will give other movers a good idea of the many neighborhoods, job opportunities, entertainment options, and school districts that this wonderful place has to offer. 
        </p>
