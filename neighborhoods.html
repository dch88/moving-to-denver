    <h1>Some of Denver's Best Neighborhoods</h1>
    <p>Below are some of the neighborhoods that I have learned the most about. All statistical data comes from <a href="https://www.niche.com/places-to-live/search/best-neighborhoods/m/denver-metro-area/">niche.com</a>, which is a great resource that I have used a lot. <a href="https://www.uncovercolorado.com/best-neighborhoods-in-denver-co/">Uncover Colorado</a> has also been a great resource for me.
        All of these neighborhoods are within city limits. If you’d like a list that includes Denver suburbs, visit <a href="https://www.pods.com/blog/2020/12/denver-neighborhoods/">this page on pods.com</a>.

        <h2>Lower Highlands (LoHi)</h2>

             alt="LoHi Picture" 
             width="40%">

        <p> Just a short walk across the river from downtown Denver is my personal favorite neighborhood, the Lower Highlands, commonly known has LoHi. LoHi is part of the greater Highland area that makes up most of the city’s area on this side of the river, and offers a great mix of residential streets and bars/coffee shops, families and young people, and culture and quiet.

             width="40%">

        <p> If you’re constantly in search of the party, LoDo is the place for you. Just northwest of the Central Business District, Lower Downtown has all the restaurants and bars a neighborhood could offer, while also making that Monday morning commute a bit more tolerable. Coors Field is also right nearby for lovers of America’s Pastime.

             alt="RiNO Picture"
             width="40%">

        <p> Five Points is a wide-ranging and diverse neighborhood, so it’s hard to come up with a simple description that suits the whole neighborhood. The best way I can think to describe it is as the cultural hub of Denver. Five Points has lots of live music venues and eccentric food options, as well as the sub-neighborhood River North Arts District, commonly known as RiNO (noticing a theme here?). RiNO is an old converted warehouse district with plenty of galleries and art every way you look.

        <h2>Capitol Hill</h2>

             alt="Cap Hill Picture"
             width="40%">

        <p>I like to think of Capitol Hill as the less expensive version of Five Points. It too has lots of culture, art, music, and food/drink options, but the lower price tag draws a large number of younger and first-time Denver residents. Cap Hill also offers close proximity to the central business district and is generally centrally-located, making it a good jumping off point to visit other parts of the city.

        <h2>Washington Park</h2>

        alt="Wash Park Picture"
        width="40%">

        <p> If you want the benefits of city life but with more greenery and without all the hustle and bustle, Washington Park is the place for you. Located a few miles south of downtown, this neighborhood definitely has a more residential vibe than the others on this list, making it the most family-friendly of these options, but also the most expensive. The park that is the neighborhood’s namesake is a wonderful place to spend a leisurely weekend afternoon. While the majority of space is residential, Washington Park still has a main drag of coffee shops and restaurants on S Gaylord St.
