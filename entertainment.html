    <h1>Entertainment in Denver (and beyond)</h1>
    <p>In my humble opinion, there is no place with a wider variety of options for having a good time than Denver. Whether your into the outdoors, live music, sports, all of the above, or just about anything else, Denver has something for you.
    </p>
    <h2>The Rocky Mountains</h2>

    <p>Like many others who have moved here, the great outdoors is one of the main reasons I fell in love with Colorado. Skiing in the winter, and hiking/climbing/camping/you name it in the winter. There is way too much information on this vast mountain range for me to list here, so I'll instead point you to a few great sites I have found.</p>

    <h2>Red Rocks Ampitheatre</h2>

    <p>Just 20 minutes from downtown Denver lies argulably the most majestic and jaw-dropping natural ampitheatre in the country, if not the world: Red Rocks. What more could a music lover possibly want?</p>

    <p>The "Big 4" professional sports in the US are football (NFL), baseball (MLB), basketball (NBA), and hockey (NHL). And guess what? Denver has a team for all four! People in Denver are incredibly passionate about the teams, especially the Broncos (NFL). The Nuggets are also one of the most promising young teams in the NBA.</p>
